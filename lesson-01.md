# Assignment

1. Odd or Even
    Write a program that asks the user to input a number and tells them whether the number is odd or even.
    Itâ€™s a simple way to practice conditionals and mod (%) operations.
1. Simple Calculator
    Ask your son to create a simple calculator that takes two numbers as input and performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input (e.g., +, -, *, /).
    This helps practice input/output, variables, and control flow (if-else).
